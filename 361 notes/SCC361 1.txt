	Explainability = Demonstrate how an AI came to a solution
	Uncertainty/Robustness = How confident is the AI with its decision
	
	
	
	
	History of AI {
		
		Early Days
		------------------------------------
		1943: McCulloch & Pitts
		Boolean Circuit Model of Brain
		
		1950: Turing
		Computing Machinery and Intelligence
		
		
		Excitement
		------------------------------------
		1950s: Early AI Programs
		Samuel's checkers program
		Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist
		Gelernter's Geometry Engine
		
		1956: Darthmouth Meeting
		Artificial Intelligence adopted
		
		1965: Robinson
		Complete algorithm for logical reasoning
		
		
		Knowledge-based approaches
		------------------------------------
		1969-79: Early development
		
		1980-88: Expert systems
		Industry Booms
		
		1988-93: Expert systems industry bursts
		AI Winter
		
		Statistical Approaches + Subfield Expertise
		------------------------------------
		Resurgence of probability, focus on uncertain
		General increase in technical depth
		Agents and machine learning systems
		AI Spring?
		
		Excitement (Now)
		------------------------------------
		Big data, big compute, deep neural networks
		Some re-unification of subfields
		AI used in many industries

	The Thinking Machine {
		
		What is AI? {
		
			Approach 1: Thinking like a human
			Approach 2: Acting like a human
				Mimicing human behaviour
			Approach 3: Thinking rationally
			Approach 4: Acting rationally
			
			
						 Human				 Rational
						+-------------------------------------
			Thinking	|Systems that		| Systems that
						|think like humans	| think rationally
						|-------------------|-----------------
			Acting		|Systems that		| Systems that
						|act like humans	| act rationally
						+-------------------------------------
			
			What is an Agent? {
				
				Definition = Something that acts within an environment
				
				Acts intelligently if:
				- Action is appropriate
				- Flexible to change
				- Learns from experience
				- Makes appropriate choices
				
				Computational Agent: Agent whose decisions and actions can be explained in terms of computation
				
				Rational Agent: Acts to achieve best outcome
			}
			
			AI studies the synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently
		}
	}
	
	Goals of AI {
	
		Scientific Goal = Understanding principles of intelligent behaviour
		Engineering Goal = Concerned with constructing intelligent agents
		
		Business Benefits:
		- Workflow automation
		- Enhance creative tasks
		- Increased accuracy
		- Better predictions
		
		Social Benefits:
		- Healthcare
		- Smart cities, transport, security
		- Forecasts and predictions
		- Agriculture
		- Overall Lifestyle
		
	}
	
	Risks and Challenges {
		
		Safety and Security
		Trust and Social Manipulation
		Explainable AI
		Possible Job Loss
	
	}
	
	Ethical Concerns {
		
		Accountability
		Accuracy, Bias, Privacy and Inequality
		AI learns from data from humans, which may encode prejudice
		Technological Social Responsibility
		
	}
	
	Machine Learning {
		
		AI systems were mostly rule-based
		Machine Learning drives AI
		
		Machine Learning = Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn, without being explicitly programmed
		
		Declarative Knowledge = Accumulation of old facts
		Imperative Knowledge = Deduce new facts from old facts
		
		Supervised Learning = Tell computer how to learn
			- Classification = Relationships and Categories
			- Regression = Predicting
			Mapping input to an output
			
			
		Unsupervised Learning = 
			- Clustering = Inherent Grouping within data
			- Association =
