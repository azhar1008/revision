	What is a Digital Image? {
		
		Digital Image {
			Defined as a grid, as a 2D Function f(x,y);
				x,y are spatial coordinates of a pixel
				f: is amplitude of any pairs (x,y) of coordinates
					Called intensity or grey level at that point
		}
	
		Sampling {
		
			Simple Image Formation Model:
			- Illumination Source (Energy)
			- Scene
			- Imaging System
			- Projection of the scene onto the image plane
			- Digitized Image
			
			Concepts in Simple Image Formation:
				Scene is continuous space
				Cannot store continuous data in uncontinuous space
				Must represent in digitized space
				Sampling of continuous data
			
			Converting light into voltage
			Sampling at certain points
			Provides limited number of points in a continuous area
			
			Need to quantize image to make image easier to process
			
			Number of sensors = How deeply image is quantized
			
			Continuous Image projected onto sensor array
			->
			Result of image sampling and quantization
			
			Increase in Range of Quantization = Increase in Memory
			
			+ Sampling = + Quality
			+ Quantization = + Light Intensity
				We use 0 to 255 usually
		}
	
	}
	
	Different Types of Digital Images {
		
		Image Modalities  {

			2D Images
				Binary Image = Quantized using 1 bit (Mono)
				Gray Image = Quantized using intensity values
				Colour Image = Quantized using RGB Colour space (3 Matrices)
			
			2.5D Images = Shows Depth and Distance of each point of scene from camera
			
			3D Images

	Lecture 2 {
		
		Image Processing {
			
			Processing = Subclass of signal processing specifically concerned with images
			
			Processing Areas:
			- Compression
			
			
			
			Compression {
			
				Image Coding = Representing images with least information consistent with an acceptable quality
			
				Compression Ratio = Uncompressed / Compression
				
				Lossy and Lossless {
					
					Lossless = Allows original image to be perfectly reconstructed from original data
						- Decoded data of original
						- Low compression ratio
						- Common for texts, executable programs, source code, spreadsheets
					
					Lossy = Certain amount of information is discarded
						- Data is lost and not 100% Originality
						- High compression ratio
						- Common for image, video, audio
						- User perception is main objective
						
				}
				
				Why do we code images? {
					- Saves storage
					- Less bandwidth
					- Faster speed
					- Less consumed power
					- Smaller equipment
					
					+ Storage Capacity
					+ Transmission Capacity
					
					Enables technology for image storage and distribution
					
					
				}
				
				Standards {
					Image Coding needs a standard to decode
					
					Criteria:
					- Ratio
					- Complexity (Speed)
					- Implementation Difficulty
					- Progressive Decoding
					- Scalability
					
					Decompression > Compression
					- Decompression is done more than once
				}
				
				System {
					Image -> Compressor = Compressed Image
					Compressed Image -> Decoder = Image
					
					Compressed = {Mapper, Quantizer, Symbol Coder}
					Decoder = {Symbol Coder, Inverse Mapper}
					
					
				}
				
			}
			
			Enhancement {
				
				Aims: 
					1. Improve human perception of image
					2. Provide better input for other automated image processing techniques
					3. Reduce Noise in Image
				
				Examples:
				- Intensity Correction
				- Improve Sharpness
				- Image Restoration
				- Reduce Noise
				
			}
			
			Understanding / Computer Vision {
				Definition = Interprets regions and objects in image to figure out what actually happens in the image
				- Understands content of image
				
				Computer Vision = Enables computers to see and understand images in the same way that human vision does and provide appropriate output
