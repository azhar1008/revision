366 Week 2

Lecture 1 {
	
	Fundamentals of a Digital Image {
		An Image is represented by a grid of pictures and elements called pixels
		Pixels arranged in columns and rows
	}
	
	Image Types {
	
		RGB = Sum of colour intensities of Red, Green and Blue
			Max intensity is White
		
		Y Cb Cr = Y is luminances, Cb and Cr are colour vectors
		
		HSV = Hue, Saturation and Brightness
		
		Can be converted easily
		
	}
	
	Processing Images {
		
		g(x,y) = T[f(x,y)]
		
		Spatial Domain
			Image Plane itself
			Processing in the spatial domain deals with direct manipulation of the image pixels
			We consider the intesity values of the pixel value
			
			Spatial Filtering :
				We consider the intesity values of the neighbouring values
			
			
			
		Frequency Domain
			
	
	}
	
	Basic Intensity Transformations {
		
		g(x,y) = T[f(x,y)]
		
		Image Negatives = g(x,y) = L - 1 - f(x,y)
		
		Log Transformation = Expands dark pixel whilst compressing white pixels
							- Increases dynamic range of low intensities
							- Dynamic range refers to the ratio of max and min intesity values
							
							- Mainly used to increase detail in images with a higher intensity than capturable
							
							g(x,y) = c log(1 + f(x,y))
							c is constant and f(x,y) >= 0
							
		Power law (Gamma) transformation = g(x,y) = c f(x,y) ^ Î³
		
		Piecewise Linear Transformation = Take 4 values from input
											Map values
										
											(Cubic Bezier Concept?)
										
										 Stretches Contrast
		
		Bit Plane Slicing = Cut a greyscale image into levels of darkness
							
							Value & 11000000, Value & 110000, Value & 1100, Value & 11
							
							Focus on MSB
